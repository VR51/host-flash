2.7.1

	- Fix: Removed AdAway. No longer required.
	-	Fix: Changed hosts-file.net file download from .zip to .txt format. Changed due to download errors with .zip.
	
2.7.0

	- Fix: Added missing sudo command to the sed line used for blocklist removal. Only affected cases where users answere 'Yes' to the 'Remove blocklist' question.
	- Enhancement (alpha): New dialogue method abstraction layer. This will (eventually) allow use of a desktop GUI and text only legacy mode and improve adaptability of the program to more OS environments. This release contains little of the new library. Version 3.0.0 will contain the full 'Salli' library.
	- Minor: Changed default redirect IP address to 0.0.0.0. Requests to 0.0.0.0 resolve quicker than those to 127.0.0.1.
	- Minor: Rearranged some code blocks to match program execution order of new features.
	
2.6.0

	- New: 3 New host blacklist providers. Hosts files can now be downloaded from someonewhocares.org (Dan Pollock's List), adaway.org, malwaredomainlist.com
	- Enhancement: Refactored code. Improved for readability. Condensed code. Increased use of loops and arrays for directory and file creation.
	- Enhancement: Condensed required download package to 1 script file. The full package builds itself when host-flash.sh is first executed. Automatically creates directories and downloads needed files.
	- Enhancement: Improved the add_to_log function. Now adds log messages to the log file and displays messages to the screen (hidden behind dialogue boxes in some cases - scroll up if you need to or just read the log file).
	- New: New debug option. Program contains debug='' variable setting. Set to debug='true' to enable debug feature. This option acts on the add_to_log function. When enabled program execution halts after each log message pending user key press to step forward.
	- Enhancement: Changed leave_program function to use a dialogue box. Function now accepts input string to display in exit message.
	- Organisation: moved files around in the Host Flash directory. Existing custom whitelists and blacklists will be moved, not deleted, when then program update routine runs.
	- Minor: Set Host Flash to print source hosts file download credits at the top of Host Flash compiled hosts blacklist.
	- Minor: Removed option to preserve the temp directory. Use Debug option instead. The option to preserve the temp directory was only present for debug purposes anyway.

    - Organisation: Moved whitelist.txt, whitelist-wild.txt and blocklist.txt to their own direcety. They are now in Host Flash/custom/. Move made to produce a human friendly file structure.
    - Minor: Adjusted error messages to make them easier to understand.
    - Minor: Made information dialogs shorter to improve userfriendliness. Users are now directed to the readme.txt file and hosts-flash.com.
    - Bugfix: Host Flash checked for 7z archive package by testing for p7zip and p7zip-full. This test caused Host Flash to sometimes wrongly report a missing dependency error. Test changed to look for 7z directly.
    - Notice: The current sample whitelists and blocklist will be removed in version 3. The Community Whitelist Installer will provide sample files if needed.
